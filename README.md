# Flappy_Bird_Project
Low fidelity version of the Flappy Bird game.  


I created this game because Flappy Bird is no longer available.It is on of my favorite mini
games to play so I decided to make my own little application that I could enjoy on my own PC. 

Thank You to Jaryt Bustard for the help via his video tutorial. This is his game that I altered 
for my own purposes.
